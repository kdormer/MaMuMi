# MaMuMi
MaMuMi “Mapping the Music of Migration” is a two-year European, Erasmus+ musical inheritance project focused on talking about music and song as a tool for intercultural competency. It involves the collection, editing and uploading of “Song Stories”, stories about music to an interactive app. These stories focus on “inheritance tracks”; the songs or music that migrants have inherited, the discussion of which acts as a platform for diversity awareness in dedicated MaMuMi “Song Worlds” Workshops’.
